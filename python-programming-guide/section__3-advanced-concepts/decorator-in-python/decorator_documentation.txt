What is decorator in python?
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
1. A Decorator is a function that takes another function and extends the behavior of the latter function without 
   explicitly modifying it.
2. Decorators are often used for tasks such as logging, validation, authorization, and code instrumentation.
3. They are especially useful for applying common behavior to multiple functions in a clean and consistent manner.

Order of execution decorator applied to a function
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
When a function uses multiple decorators, the order of execution is from the innermost (closest to the function) to 
the outermost (farthest from the function). 

This means that the decorator closest to the function is executed first
