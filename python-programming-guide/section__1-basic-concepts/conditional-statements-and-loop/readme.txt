match statement
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
A match statement takes an expression and compares its value to successive patterns given as one or more case blocks. 

This is superficially similar to a switch statement in C, Java or JavaScript (and many other languages), but itâ€™s more
similar to pattern matching in languages like Rust or Haskell.
