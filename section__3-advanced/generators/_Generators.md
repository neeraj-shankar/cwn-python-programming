## Generators in Python

### **What Are Generators?**

A **generator** is a special type of iterable in Python. Unlike lists or tuples, generators don’t store all their values in memory at once. Instead, they yield one value at a time as you iterate over them, making them highly memory efficient, especially for large datasets.

### **How Are Generators Created?**

1. **Generator Functions**

   Generator functions look like normal functions but use the `yield` keyword to produce a value each time the generator is iterated.

   ```python
   def simple_generator():
       yield 1
       yield 2
       yield 3

   gen = simple_generator()
   for value in gen:
       print(value)
   ```

   Output:

   ```
   1
   2
   3
   ```
2. **Generator Expressions**

   Similar to list comprehensions, but use parentheses `()` instead of square brackets `[]`.

   ```python
   gen_expr = (x ** 2 for x in range(5))
   print(next(gen_expr))  # Output: 0
   print(next(gen_expr))  # Output: 1
   ```

### **How Generators Work Internally**

* The `yield` keyword pauses the function and saves its state.
* The next time you call `next()` on the generator, it resumes execution right after the last `yield`.

### **Key Advantages of Generators**

1. **Memory Efficiency**

   Generators produce items on-the-fly, avoiding the need to store entire datasets in memory.
2. **Infinite Sequences**

   Generators can represent infinite sequences since they generate values one at a time.

   ```python
   def infinite_counter():
       n = 0
       while True:
           yield n
           n += 1

   counter = infinite_counter()
   print(next(counter))  # Output: 0
   print(next(counter))  # Output: 1
   ```
3. **Pipeline Processing**

   They are ideal for chaining operations and processing streams of data.

### **Advanced Generator Techniques**

1. **Sending Values with `send()`**
   Generators can accept input using the `send()` method.

   ```python
   def interactive_gen():
       value = 0
       while True:
           value = yield value
           print(f"Received: {value}")

   gen = interactive_gen()
   next(gen)  # Start the generator
   gen.send(10)  # Output: Received: 10
   ```
2. **Generator-Based Coroutines**
   Generators can be used for cooperative multitasking (precursor to Python’s `asyncio`).
3. **Using `yield from`**
   Delegates part of its operations to another generator.

   ```python
   def sub_gen():
       yield 1
       yield 2

   def main_gen():
       yield from sub_gen()
       yield 3

   for value in main_gen():
       print(value)
   ```

   Output:

   ```
   1
   2
   3
   ```

### **Real-World Applications**

1. **File Processing**

   Read large files line-by-line without loading the entire file into memory.

   ```python
   def read_large_file(file_path):
       with open(file_path, 'r') as file:
           for line in file:
               yield line
   ```
2. **Streaming Data**

   Process incoming data streams in real-time (e.g., logs or live APIs).
3. **Data Pipelines**

   Chain transformations efficiently.

   ```python
   data = (x * 2 for x in range(10))
   filtered = (x for x in data if x > 10)
   print(list(filtered))  # Output: [12, 14, 16, 18]
   ```
4. **Generating Infinite Data**

   Useful for tasks like generating test data or simulations.
