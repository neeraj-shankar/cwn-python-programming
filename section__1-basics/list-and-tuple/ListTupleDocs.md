# Python Basics -- List and Tuples

---

## ðŸ”¸ 1. **List in Python**

A **list** is a mutable, ordered collection of items that can hold elements of different data types.

### âœ… **Basic Syntax:**

```python
my_list = [1, 2, 3, "apple", True]
```

#### âœ… **Key Features:**

* Ordered
* Mutable (can be modified)
* Allows duplicate elements
* Can contain mixed data types (int, str, bool, etc.)


## ðŸ”¹ 2. **Tuple in Python**

A **tuple** is an immutable, ordered collection of elements.

### âœ… **Basic Syntax:**

```python
my_tuple = (1, 2, 3, "apple", True)
```

> âœ… You can also create a tuple with a single element like: `single = (5,)` (Note the comma!)

### âœ… **Key Features:**

* Ordered
* **Immutable** (cannot be changed after creation)
* Allows duplicate elements
* Can contain mixed data types

Great idea! Adding **space and time complexity** to the operations table gives a deeper understanding, especially for performance-critical scenarios.

### ðŸ§  Notes on Space Complexity:

* **Lists** are dynamic arrays. When appending, Python may allocate extra space (overallocation) to optimize performance â€” this affects real-world space usage.
* **Tuples** are more space-efficient than lists for the same number of elements because they are immutable and donâ€™t require memory for dynamic resizing.
