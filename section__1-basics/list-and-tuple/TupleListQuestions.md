# FAQs on Tuple and List

## **1. Why are tuples immutable, and how does that affect their performance and usability?**

### 🔹 1. **What does "immutable" mean?**

A data structure is **immutable** if it **cannot be changed after creation** — this means:

* No adding, removing, or modifying elements.
* Any attempt to do so raises a `TypeError`.

```python
t = (1, 2, 3)
t[1] = 100  # ❌ TypeError: 'tuple' object does not support item assignment
```

### 🔹 2. **Why are tuples immutable?**

#### ✅ **Design Intent and Use Cases**

* Tuples are often used to represent **fixed collections of data** (e.g., coordinates, dates, configuration values).
* Immutability ensures **integrity** of such data — it won’t accidentally change.

#### ✅ **Hashability**

* Because they’re immutable, tuples can be **hashed**, meaning they can be used as:

  * Keys in dictionaries
  * Elements in sets

```python
t = (1, 2)
d = {t: "value"}  # ✅ Works fine
```

Lists, being mutable, cannot be hashed:

```python
l = [1, 2]
hash(l)  # ❌ TypeError: unhashable type: 'list'
```

### 🔹 3. **How does immutability affect performance?**

| Aspect            | Tuple                              | List                               |
| ----------------- | ---------------------------------- | ---------------------------------- |
| **Memory**  | More compact (no dynamic resizing) | Over-allocated memory (for growth) |
| **Speed**   | Faster for iteration and access    | Slightly slower due to overhead    |
| **Hashing** | Hashable                           | Not hashable                       |
| **Copying** | Cheap (safe to share across code)  | Requires copying for safety        |

> ✅ **Tuples are generally faster** than lists when used in fixed, read-only data scenarios — they involve fewer memory and CPU operations.

### 🔹 4. **Usability Implications**

#### ✅ **Pros:**

* Ideal for returning multiple values from a function.
* Safe to share between threads or parts of code.
* Useful as keys in dicts or elements in sets.
* Encourages functional, predictable code.

#### ❌ **Cons:**

* Not suitable when frequent updates to data are needed.
* Accidental immutability can lead to refactor overhead.

### 🔹 5. **Example Use Case**

```python
def get_user_info():
    return ("Alice", 30, "Engineer")  # Use tuple for fixed structure

name, age, job = get_user_info()  # Tuple unpacking
```

> In contrast, if the user’s data might change (e.g., adding skills), you’d prefer a list or a dictionary.
