Excellent — this is a core Python idea that really opens the door to mastering its internals.

### 🔹 “Everything is an object” — What does it **really** mean?

In Python, **everything** — numbers, strings, functions, lists, even **classes themselves** — are **instances of some class**. That class is called a **type**.

Let’s walk through what that actually looks like.

---

### ✅ Example 1: Regular objects

```python
x = 5
print(type(x))  # <class 'int'>
```

Here, `x` is an **object**, and it is an **instance of the `int` class**.

---

### ✅ Example 2: Functions are objects

```python
def greet():
    return "Hello"

print(type(greet))  # <class 'function'>
print(greet.__class__)  # <class 'function'>
```

Functions are objects of the `function` class.

---

### ✅ Example 3: Classes are also objects

```python
class Dog:
    pass

print(type(Dog))        # <class 'type'>
print(Dog.__class__)    # <class 'type'>
```

Even **the class `Dog` itself is an object** — and it is an **instance of `type`**!

---

### 🔄 What's going on?

* In Python:

  * `x = 5` → `5` is an instance of `int`
  * `int` is a **class** (defined in C under the hood)
  * But `int` is itself an **object of `type`**
  * `type` is a **metaclass**, the class of all classes

---

### 🔁 Self-looping Magic:

```python
print(type(int))     # <class 'type'>
print(type(type))    # <class 'type'>
```

So `type` is an object of itself 🤯 — this is intentional in Python to unify everything under the concept of **objects**.

### 📌 Summary:

| Entity      | Is an object? | Instance of... |
| ----------- | ------------- | -------------- |
| `5`         | ✅             | `int`          |
| `"hello"`   | ✅             | `str`          |
| `[1, 2]`    | ✅             | `list`         |
| `Dog` class | ✅             | `type`         |
| `greet()`   | ✅             | `function`     |
| `type`      | ✅             | `type`         |

This system is what allows Python to be **highly dynamic**, where you can:

* Create classes at runtime
* Modify classes and functions
* Build frameworks like Django, Flask, etc., which rely on metaprogramming

Would you like to see how you can dynamically create a class using `type()` to prove this in action?
