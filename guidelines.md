Here are some key points from PEP 8:

### Naming Conventions:

1. **Function and Variable Names:**
   - Should be lowercase with words separated by underscores.
   
   ```python
   def my_function():
       pass

   my_variable = 42
   ```

2. **Constants:**
   - Should be in uppercase with underscores separating words.

   ```python
   MAX_SIZE = 100
   ```

3. **Class Names:**
   - Should be in mixed case (CamelCase).

   ```python
   class MyClass:
       pass
   ```

### Best Practices:

1. **Indentation:**
   - Use 4 spaces per indentation level.

2. **Whitespace:**
   - Avoid extraneous whitespace.

3. **Comments:**
   - Keep comments concise and meaningful.

4. **Docstrings:**
   - Use docstrings to document modules, classes, and functions.

5. **Imports:**
   - Imports should usually be on separate lines.

   ```python
   import os
   import sys
   ```

6. **Limit Line Length:**
   - Limit all lines to a maximum of 79 characters.

7. **Blank Lines:**
   - Separate functions and classes with two blank lines.

8. **Exception Handling:**
   - Don't use a bare `except:` clause.

   ```python
   try:
       # code
   except ValueError:
       # handle the specific exception
   ```

PEP 8 is widely adopted in the Python community, and many Python developers and projects follow its guidelines. It's a good practice to adhere to these conventions to ensure consistency and readability in your Python code.
